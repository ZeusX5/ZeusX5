- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZeusX5
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working on cars or playing games, but lately has been coding/thinking of projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python with no real focus right now, but trying a little bit of everything. Eventually, would like to get to learn some JS and others.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me Batman-style signal?
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned a little bit of coding with HTML and Dreamweaver, but also when I created a simple game in Game Maker. Wasn't sure what language was the little code I did do though. Also, when I was kid I missed 4th of July because I was playing Sonic on my older brother's Sega Saturn. My parents told me to stop playing and go outside to blow up some fireworks. I went out, set off two or three bottle rockets and snuck back inside to play more.
